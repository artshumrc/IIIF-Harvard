        <strong>Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections</strong> is the first exhibition to showcase highlights of illuminated manuscripts in the Boston area. An ambitious collaborative project, Beyond Words is notable for the size of its curatorial team, the number of lending institutions, and a multi-venue display. The exhibition presents more than 260 outstanding manuscripts and printed books from nineteen Boston-area collections, dating from the ninth to the seventeenth centuries. The exhibit is supplemented by an extensive catalog, a three-day symposium, and public programming. <a href="http://beyondwords2016.org/">Explore the website</a> for additional information on Beyond Words.

        <a href="http://darthcrimson.org/">Harvard Arts & Humanities Research Computing</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://archimedes.digital/">Archimedes Digital</a>, provided exhibit support by building annotated IIIF manifests that could be viewed live in the galleries. These live views made use of Mirador and provided the public with the ability to interact with the material on display in digital preservation format. In addition, the Mirador instances showcased scholarly annotations created by the event curators.
