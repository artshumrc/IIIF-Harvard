        <p>
          Arts and Humanities Research Computing supports faculty and student research in the divisions of the arts and humanities and the humanistic social sciences. We consult on individual research projects, hold workshops on digital methodologies of particular use in those efforts, but have collaborated to develop research infrastructure, particularly with the Harvard Library, HarvardX, and Academic Technology for FAS (HUIT). Mirador and IIIF are excellent examples of such collaboration, and we are now focused on collecting use cases of research projects that stretch the current capabilities of Mirador and IIIF.
        <p>
          For an excellent example, please explore <a href="/collaborators/jeffrey-hamburger.html">Professor Jeffrey Hamburgerâ€™s commentary</a> (via Mirador-based annotation) on a fragmentary medieval manuscript held at Harvard. The commentary elucidates both the liturgical text and the symbolism of the illuminated letters that it contains as well as explaining how the system of included texts celebrates St. John the Evangelist.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also collaborated with Professor Racha Kirakosian to customize the <a href="http://digital-editing.fas.harvard.edu:4567/">TEI Web Editor</a> originally developed by Jeff Witt for use in a graduate seminar course on medieval German paleography. The Web Editor uses Mirador to display manuscripts for transcription and TEI encoding, and uses Harvard's GitHub Enterprise infrastructure to store the XML files. The resulting editions are available for viewing at <a href="http://digital-editing.fas.harvard.edu/">Exploring Medieval Mary Magdalene</a>, also developed by Arts and Humanities Research Computing.
